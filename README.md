- HiðŸ‘‹, my name is @IonutCorbu!
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in everything about computers.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Computer Science and Cyber security at Military Technical Academy from Bucharest.

As a computer science student, I'm passionate about exploring the latest technologies and programming languages. I use GitHub to expose my university projects or my private projects, and to improve my coding skills. 
My GitHub repositories show my manner to work on some projects, from web applications to Operating System Design projects, and showcase my proficiency in languages such as C/C++, C#+WPF, JavaScript+CSS+HTML.
